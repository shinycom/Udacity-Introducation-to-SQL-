Question 2. For the region with the largest (sum) of sales total_amt_usd, how many total (count) orders were placed?

step 1. join 3 tables sales_reps, accounts and orders.
step 2. find out which region has the most sum(total_amt_usd) and it turns out region_id = 1 has the most orders placed. 

select t1.region_id
from(
select s.region_id, sum(o.total_amt_usd)
from sales_reps s
join accounts a
on s.id = a.sales_rep_id
join orders o
on a.id = o.account_id
group by 1
order by sum desc
limit 1) t1

step3. join 4 tables and using where clause to filter out orders that region_id equals the result from step 2.  In a form of where region_id = (subsql from step 2)

select r.name, count(o.account_id)
from sales_reps s
join accounts a
on s.id = a.sales_rep_id
join orders o
on a.id = o.account_id
join region r
on r.id = s.region_id
where r.id = (
  select t1.region_id
  from(
  select s.region_id, sum(o.total_amt_usd)
  from sales_reps s
  join accounts a
  on s.id = a.sales_rep_id
  join orders o
  on a.id = o.account_id
  group by 1
  order by sum desc
  limit 1) t1 )
  group by 1

solution from Udacity as follow
This provides the Northeast with 2357 orders.

SELECT r.name, COUNT(o.total) total_orders
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY r.name
HAVING SUM(o.total_amt_usd) = (
      SELECT MAX(total_amt)
      FROM (SELECT r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
              FROM sales_reps s
              JOIN accounts a
              ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
              JOIN orders o
              ON o.account_id = a.id
              JOIN region r
              ON r.id = s.region_id
              GROUP BY r.name) sub);
              
More simple solution from Udacity

SELECT t1.region, t1.total_orders
FROM
(SELECT r.name region, SUM (o.total_amt_usd) total_sales, COUNT (o.total) total_orders
FROM region r
JOIN sales_reps s
ON r.id = s.region_id
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1) t1;
