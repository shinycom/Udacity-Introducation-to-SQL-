Udacity 1st project: Investigate a Relational Database 

Question Set # 2

Question 1:
We want to find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental orders during every month for all the years we have data for. Write a query that returns the store ID for the store, the year and month and the number of rental orders each store has fulfilled for that month. Your table should include a column for each of the following: year, month, store ID and count of rental orders fulfilled during that month.

For this query, you will need table rental and customer.

with temp as(
  select extract(month from r.rental_date) rental_month, extract(year from r.rental_date) as rental_year, s.store_id, count(rental_id) as count_rentals
  from rental r
  join staff s
  on r.staff_id = s.staff_id
  group by 1, 2, 3
  order by 2, 1, 3
)
select concat(rental_year, '-' ,rental_month) as date, store_id, count_rentals
from temp


Question 2
We would like to know who were our top 10 paying customers, how many payments they made on a monthly basis during 2007, and what was the amount of the monthly payments. Can you write a query to capture the customer name, month and year of payment, and total payment amount for each month by these top 10 paying customers?

/*  create a temp table filting out top 10 customers */
with topcustomer as(
  select c.customer_id, concat(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) full_name, sum(p.amount)
  from customer c
  join payment p
  on c.customer_id = p.customer_id
  group by 1, 2
  order by 3 desc
  limit 10
)
select date_trunc('month', p.payment_date) pay_month,  t.full_name, count(p.payment_id) payct_per_month, sum(p.amount) pay_amount
from payment p
join topcustomer t
on t.customer_id = p.customer_id and
extract(year from p.payment_date) = 2007
group by 1, 2
order by 2, 1
