Udacity 1st project: Investigate a Relational Database 

Question Set # 2

Question 1:
We want to find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental orders during every month for all the years we have data for. Write a query that returns the store ID for the store, the year and month and the number of rental orders each store has fulfilled for that month. Your table should include a column for each of the following: year, month, store ID and count of rental orders fulfilled during that month.

For this query, you will need table rental and customer.

with temp as(
  select extract(month from r.rental_date) rental_month, extract(year from r.rental_date) as rental_year, s.store_id, count(rental_id) as count_rentals
  from rental r
  join staff s
  on r.staff_id = s.staff_id
  group by 1, 2, 3
  order by 2, 1, 3
)
select concat(rental_year, '-' ,rental_month) as date, store_id, count_rentals
from temp
