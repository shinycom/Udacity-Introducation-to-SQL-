Udacity 1st project: Investigate a Relational Database 

Question Set # 1 

Question 1
We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. The following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.

Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out.

For this query, you will need 5 tables: Category, Film_Category, Inventory, Rental and Film. Your solution should have three columns: Film title, Category name and Count of Rentals.

with t1 as(
    select f.title film_title, c.name category_name, r.rental_id rental
    from film f
    join film_category fc
    on f.film_id = fc.film_id
    join category c
    on fc.category_id = c.category_id
    join inventory i
    on f.film_id = i.film_id
    join rental r
    on i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id)

select film_title, category_name, count(rental)
from t1
where category_name in ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')
group by 1, 2
order by 2, 1
