Udacity 1st project: Investigate a Relational Database 

Question Set # 1 

Question 1
We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. The following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.

Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out.

For this query, you will need 5 tables: Category, Film_Category, Inventory, Rental and Film. Your solution should have three columns: Film title, Category name and Count of Rentals.

with t1 as(
    select f.title film_title, c.name category_name, r.rental_id rental
    from film f
    join film_category fc
    on f.film_id = fc.film_id
    join category c
    on fc.category_id = c.category_id
    join inventory i
    on f.film_id = i.film_id
    join rental r
    on i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id)

select film_title, category_name, count(rental)
from t1
where category_name in ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')
group by 1, 2
order by 2, 1




with t1 as(
    select f.title film_title, c.name category_name, r.rental_id rental
    from film f
    join film_category fc
    on f.film_id = fc.film_id
    join category c
    on fc.category_id = c.category_id
    join inventory i
    on f.film_id = i.film_id
    join rental r
    on i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id),

t2 as(
    select film_title, category_name, count(rental)
    from t1
    where category_name in ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')
    group by 1, 2
    order by 2, 1)

select category_name, sum(count)
from t2
group by 1
order by 2 desc



Question 2
Now we need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies compares to the duration that all movies are rented for. Can you provide a table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter) based on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies across all categories? Make sure to also indicate the category that these family-friendly movies fall into.

For this query, you will need 3 tables: Category, Film_Category, and Film. 

select f.title film_title, c.name category_name, f.rental_duration, ntile(4) over (order by f.rental_duration) standard_quartile
from film f
join film_category fc
on f.film_id = fc.film_id
join category c
on fc.category_id = c.category_id
where c.name in ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')




Question 3
Finally, provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the quartiles, and the corresponding count of movies within each combination of film category for each corresponding rental duration category. The resulting table should have three columns:

Category
Rental length category
Count

with t1 as(
    select f.title film_title, c.name category_name, f.rental_duration, ntile(4) over (order by f.rental_duration) standard_quartile
    from film f
    join film_category fc
    on f.film_id = fc.film_id
    join category c
    on fc.category_id = c.category_id
    where c.name in ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')
)
select category_name, standard_quartile, count(film_title)
from t1
group by 1, 2
order by 1, 2
